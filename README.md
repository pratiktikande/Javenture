  Javenture  - Byte by Byte 🧑‍💻

Welcome to **Javenture**, a Java journey repository where I tackle coding challenges from basics to advanced levels! This repo helps me track my progress, sharpen problem-solving skills, and build a solid Java foundation.

---

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

- **Track Progress** – Capture my evolving mastery of Java.
- **Learn Concepts** – Deep dive into algorithms, data structures, OOP, Java 8+, and more.
- **Showcase Work** – Publicly share clean, well-documented code.
- **Challenge Myself** – Solve problems progressively: Easy → Medium → Hard.

## 🌱 Repository Structure

```
/
├── easy/           # Beginner-friendly problems
├── medium/         # Intermediate challenges
├── hard/           # Advanced, complex solutions
├── src/            # Core source code (by concept or package)
├── resources/      # Supporting files (e.g. test inputs)
└── README.md       # You are here!
```

- **easy/** – Practice basic Java tasks (loops, control flow, strings, arrays).
- **medium/** – Dive into sorting, linked lists, recursion, and more.
- **hard/** – Advanced problems like graphs, trees, dynamic programming, and tricky algorithms.
- **src/** – Utility and conceptual packages as the repo evolves.
- **resources/** – Files and helpers for input/output and testing.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratiktikande/Javenture.git
   ```

2. **Structure Your Solutions**
   - Create new Java files in the appropriate folder: `easy/`, `medium/`, or `hard/`.
   - Name files by problem or concept (e.g. `AnagramChecker.java`).

3. **Compile & Run**
   ```bash
   javac File Name.java
   java ClassName
   ```

4. **Test Your Work**
   - Stay consistent!

## 🛡️ Code Style & Best Practices

- Organized solutions into logical folders.
- Clean code: meaningful names, comments, modular design.
- Consistent formatting: 4‑space indent, proper braces, null checks.
- Java 8+ features: streams, lambda expressions, etc.
